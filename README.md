  <h1 align="left">PokédexAI: The World's First Digital Pokédex</h1>
</span>

PokédexAI brings to life the iconic classifier from the original games and animated series. 
To my knoweldge, mine is the first ever working implementation from scratch that utilizes a camera and file drop funcitonalities.
The UI immerses users with the following nostalgic features:
1. Take Pictures of Pokémon — I built a camera feature that changes the drag n’ drop area into a camera that can be used to take pictures of Pokémon. You can toggle between the drag n’ drop feature and the camera using the yellow button. Once in camera mode, you will see a camera icon appear which can be used to take a photo. In the diagram below I am using an image on my iPad of the Pokémon GO UI.
2. PokédexAI speaks like Dexter — Audio descriptions for each Pokémon are available, but only play when images are fed into PokédexAI via its drag n’ drop, upload files, or camera functionality.
3. Play Original Game Music — Below the drag n’ drop zone are a set of blue buttons which can each be pressed to play/pause songs from the original Pokémon games.
4. Pokémon Cards — The screen where Pokémon are displayed is clickable. When clicked, it reveals the card for that Pokémon.
5. Search For Pokémon — The green screen area can be used to search through the Pokédex by name.
6. Toggle through Pokédex — The d-pad is functional and can be used to navigate between Pokémon in the database.
